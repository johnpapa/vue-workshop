## Lab 1: 1 - Your First Vue App

This lab will walk you through creating your first Vue app.




### Exercise 1: Create Your First Vue App

In this exercise you'll create your first Vue app




#### Step 1

Run the following command to make sure the tools are working correctly. This will use the Vue CLI to create a new project which will verify everything is working correctly.


#### Step 2

Create a file named `index.html` and open it your editor (such as VS Code)


#### Step 3

Add the following HTML to your file

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 4

Add a script tag in the `<head>` pointing to Vue in [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue)

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
</head>
```

#### Step 5

Create the following HTML to capture user input. Put it inside the `<body>`.

```html
<body>
    <div id="app">
      <input type="text" />
    </div>
</body>
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  Notice the div's "id" is set to "app". We'll use this to let Vue know where our Vue app should be placed in the HTML page.

</course-item>

#### Step 6

Create a new script tag below the div, and inside the body. Create an instance of Vue and point it to the div we just created, by it's id.

```javascript
new Vue({
    el: '#app'
});
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  The Vue instance is is now ready and knows where to put it's content on the page.

</course-item>

#### Step 7

Create a `data` property in the Vue instance. Set it equal to a function that returns an object. The object should have a `name` property set to your name.

```javascript
new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data() {
      return { name: 'John' };
    }
});
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  The data property of the Vue instance exposes our data model.

</course-item>

#### Step 8

Add this code `v-model="name"` inside of your `<input>`. Your code should look like the following code example. This binds the `name` model from our Vue instance to the input control.

```html
<div id="app">
  <input type="text" v-model="name" />
</div>
```

#### Step 9

Add the following code below your `<input>` and inside of the `<div>`. This will display the `name` model.

```html
Hello {{ name }}
```

#### Step 10

Verify your code looks like the following example.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      <input type="text" v-model="name" />
      Hello {{ name }}
    </div>
    <script>
      new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data() {
          return { name: 'John' };
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 11

Now let's open your html file. From explorer (on Windows) or finder (on macOS), drag your `index.html` file to your browser.

Your name should be displayed in your app. Type a new value and your should see the "hello" message change below it.



## Lab 2: 2 - Hello World! - The Vue CLI

This lab will walk you through getting the required tools and creating your first app with the Vue CLI




### Exercise 1: Installing the Tools

In this exercise you'll install the required tools and code to run the labs in the course.




#### Step 1

Install VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=vueworkshop-github-jopapa) if it's not already installed on your machine.


#### Step 2

Install the Vetur extension from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur&wt.mc_id=vueworkshop-github-jopapa).


<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  This extension adds additional code help for using Vue in VS Code

</course-item>

#### Step 3

Install the [Vue Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets&wt.mc_id=vueworkshop-github-jopapa) VS Code extension. This isn't required, but makes it easy to create Vue syntax.


#### Step 4

Check that you have Node.js installed by running the following command. If you don't have it on your machine install it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

```command line
node --version
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  We recommend installing the latest **LTS version** of Node.js for this workshop.

</course-item>

#### Step 5

Install the Vue CLI if you don't already have it by running the following command:

```command line
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

#### Step 6

Verify the **Vue CLI** installation by running the following command:

```command line
vue --version
```

#### Step 7

Install the Vue developer tools for Chrome from here [https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools#installation](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools#installation)


#### Step 8

Clone the GitHub repository with the lab code [https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop](https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop)

```command-line
git clone git@github.com:johnpapa/vue-workshop.git
```


### Exercise 2: Create Your First Vue App with the Vue CLI

In this exercise you'll create and serve a Vue app with the Vue CLI




#### Step 1

Run the following command to use the Vue CLI to create a new project.

```command line
vue create hello-world -d
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  The "-d" indicates you want to use all of the defaults for creating the Vue app.

</course-item>

#### Step 2

Run the following command to serve your app

```command line
npm run serve
```

#### Step 3

Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your app running in the browser



## Lab 3: 3 - Display Data and Handling Events

This lab will walk you through creating a Heroes component and display data, changing data, and handling user input events.




### Exercise 1: Display and change model values in a component

In this exercise you'll display and change model values in the component.




#### Step 1

Download the Vue Workshop code (download the .zip or do a git clone) from the following URL if you haven't already:

[https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop](https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop)

```command line
git clone git@github.com:johnpapa/vue-workshop.git
```

#### Step 2

Open to the `labs\03-data-binding\begin` folder and run `npm install`


#### Step 3

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


#### Step 4

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 5

Create a hero model in the `data()` function in the component's code. Give the hero properties with values for id, name and description.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    hero: {
      id: 101,
      name: "John",
      description: "Slayer of JavaScript"
    }
  };
},
```

#### Step 6

Create a `<p>` tag below the `<h2>`, and say hello to your hero. Then display the id and description of the hero as shown below.

```html
<p>Hello {{ hero.name }}.</p>
<p>Your id is {{ hero.id }} and your description is "{{ hero.description }}"</p>
```

#### Step 7

Create an `<input>` element of type "text" above the `<p>` tags you just created. Bind your hero's name to the input element using 2-way data-binding.

```html
<input v-model="hero.name" type="text">
```

#### Step 8

In the browser, enter a different name in the input element. Notice that when you type, the name of your hero changes in all places it is data-bound.



### Exercise 2: Handle events

In this exercise you'll handle events from user input




#### Step 1

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


#### Step 2

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 3

Create a method in the component's code named `reverseName()`. Make the code reverse your hero's name.

```javascript
methods: {
  reverseName() {
    this.hero.name = [...this.hero.name].reverse().join("");
  }
}
```

#### Step 4

Create a button inside your template. When you click the button make it call the function you just created. This should reverse the name of your hero.

```html
<button @click="reverseName()">Reverse</button>
```


### Exercise 3: Key Modifiers

In this exercise you'll handle events from user input with key modifiers




#### Step 1

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


#### Step 2

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 3

Create a method in the component's code named `upperCaseTheName()`. Make the code change your hero's name to all uppercase letters.

```javascript
methods: {
  reverseName() {
    this.hero.name = [...this.hero.name].reverse().join("");
  },
  upperCaseTheName() {
    this.hero.name = this.hero.name.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

#### Step 4

When the user presses the ENTER key inside of your input element, your hero's name should become all uppercase. Add the modifier to your input element and have it call your new function.

```html
<input v-model="hero.name" type="text" @keyup.enter="upperCaseTheName()">
```


## Lab 4: 4 - Lists and Conditionals

This lab will walk you through adding a list of heroes and showing/hiding content as appropriate.




### Exercise 1: List of Heroes

This exercise will walk you through displaying a list of heroes.




#### Step 1

Download the Vue Workshop code (download the .zip or do a git clone) from the following URL if you haven't already:

[https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop](https://github.com/johnpapa/vue-workshop)

```command line
git clone git@github.com:johnpapa/vue-workshop.git
```

#### Step 2

Open to the `labs\04-lists-conditionals\begin` folder and run `npm install`


#### Step 3

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


#### Step 4

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 5

Create an array of heroes in the `data()` function with at least three heroes. Each hero should have an id and a name property.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    heroes: [
      { id: 10, name: "Ella" },
      { id: 20, name: "Madelyn" },
      { id: 30, name: "Haley" }
    ]
  };
},
```

#### Step 6

Add a `<ul>` with an `<li>` in the template directly below the `<h2>`. Add a `v-for` directive to repeat over every item in the `heroes` model you just created.


#### Step 7

Display each hero's name in the list item `<li>`.


#### Step 8

Set the key to be the id property of each hero. Your code should now look like the following in your template.

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="hero in heroes" :key="hero.id">{{ hero.name }}</li>
</ul>
```

#### Step 9

Run the sample with `npm run serve` and open it in your browser. You should see your list of heroes!



### Exercise 2: Selecting a Hero

In this exercise you will allow the user to select a hero from the list and highlight it in yellow.



<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="">


</course-item>


#### Step 1

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 2

Create a `selectedHero` model in the `data()` function of your component's code. This will store the hero that the user selects. Set it to `undefined` by default.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    selectedHero: undefined,
    heroes: [
      { id: 10, name: "Ella" },
      { id: 20, name: "Madelyn" },
      { id: 30, name: "Haley" }
    ]
  };
},
```

#### Step 3

When the user clicks on a hero item in the template, call a new function named `selectHero`. Add the `selectHero` function to your component code in the `methods` section. Pass the hero to the new function and set the `selectedHero` model to the hero that the user selected. Your method should look like the following code

```javascript
methods: {
  selectHero(hero) {
    this.selectedHero = hero;
  }
}
```

#### Step 4

Create a style in the component named `.highlight` that changes the background color to yellow.


#### Step 5

Add a binding to the `class` of the list item in your template such that the `highlight` class is set when the user selects the hero.


#### Step 6

Verify that your template for the list looks like the following:

```html
<ul>
  <li
    v-for="hero in heroes"
    :key="hero.id"
    @click="selectHero(hero)"
    :class="{highlight: selectedHero===hero}"
  >{{ hero.name }}</li>
</ul>
```


### Exercise 3: Displaying the Selected Hero

In this exercise you will display the selected hero. it should only be displayed when a selected has been made.




#### Step 1

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue`


#### Step 2

Add a `<div>` below the `<ul>` and display a message saying that you have selected a hero.


#### Step 3

Display the name of the selected hero in the div you just created, using the model for the `selectedHero`.


#### Step 4

If you run the app right now, you may get an error in the developer tools. Why? This is because the `selectedHero` is not yet defined until the user selects a hero. We will fix this next


#### Step 5

Only display the div you just created if a hero has been selected. Use the `v-if` directive.


#### Step 6

Run the example with `npm run serve` and open it in your browser. You should see no message until you select a hero. Then you should see your message and the hero's name.

Your template should now contain a div that looks like this:

```html
<div v-if="selectedHero">You selected {{ selectedHero.name }}</div>
```


## Lab 5: 5 - Interacting within a Component

This lab will walk you through using lifecycle hooks, using computed properties, and engaging with watchers.




### Exercise 1: Using the Created LifeCycle Hook

In this exercise you'll use the `created` lifecycle hook to load your hero data your component.




#### Step 1

Open the `labs/05-interacting-within-a-component/begin` folder in your editor and run `npm install`


#### Step 2

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Notice the hero does not load. This is because we need to load the hero into the `hero` data model.


#### Step 3

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue` and notice the `hero` data model is an empty object.


#### Step 4

Add the `created` lifecycle hook in the component. This hook is called when the component is created. Make the `created` lifecycle hook call the local method `loadHero()`, which will fill the `hero` data model.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `created` hook should be at the same level as the `data()` function.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    hero: {},
    capeMessage: "",
    message: ""
  };
},
created() {
  this.loadHero();
},
```
</course-item>

#### Step 5

Notice the hero now loads in the running app!



### Exercise 2: Creating a Computed Property

In this exercise you'll created a computed property to display the full name or your hero in the component.




#### Step 1

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue` and notice the title bar says "TITLE". We are going to change that to display the hero's full name.


#### Step 2

Add a `computed` section in the component.


#### Step 3

Create a computed property named `fullName` in the `computed` section of the component. Make the `fullName` computed property return the first and last name of the hero, concatenated together with a space between them.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `computed` section should be at the same level as the `data()` function. See the following code to see what your computed might look like.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    hero: {},
    capeMessage: "",
    message: ""
  };
},
computed: {
  fullName() {
    return `${this.hero.firstName} ${this.hero.lastName}`;
  }
},
```
</course-item>

#### Step 4

Now find the HTML in your template that displays "TITLE" in the header. Replace the hard coded word "TITLE" and instead render the computed property you just created.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  TITLE was hard coded. But we need to use interpolation to render the `fullName` computed property. When complete, your code will look like the following:

```html
<header class="card-header">
  <p class="card-header-title">{{ fullName }}</p>
</header>
```
</course-item>

#### Step 5

Notice that after the hero loads that the title is the full name. Change the hero's first name or last name and you will see the title reflect those changes.



### Exercise 3: Creating a Watcher

In this exercise you will use a watcher to update the `capeMessage` data model whenever the `capeCounter` data model changes.




#### Step 1

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue` and notice the "cape message" is empty. We are going to change that to display a different message based on the value of the `capeCounter` data model.


#### Step 2

Add a `watch` section in the component.


#### Step 3

Create a watcher property that watches the `hero.capeCounter` in the `watch` section of the component. Make the watcher call the `handleTheCapes()` method, passing the `newValue` to it every time the `hero.CapeCounter` changes.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `computed` section should be at the same level as the `data()` function. See the following code to see what your computed might look like.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    hero: {},
    capeMessage: "",
    message: ""
  };
},
watch: {
  "hero.capeCounter": {
    handler(newValue, oldValue) {
      this.handleTheCapes(newValue);
    }
  }
},
```
</course-item>

#### Step 4

Notice that after the hero loads that the "cape message" is still empty. Now change the value in the "cape counter" input field. Notice the "cape message" updates with a message.

The watcher is not firing when the data is first initialized. Let's fix that.


#### Step 5

Make the watcher trigger the callback immediately with the current value of the `hero.CapeCounter` expression.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `computed` section should be at the same level as the `data()` function. See the following code to see what your computed might look like.

```javascript
watch: {
  "hero.capeCounter": {
    immediate: true,
    handler(newValue, oldValue) {
      this.handleTheCapes(newValue);
    }
  }
},
```
</course-item>

#### Step 6

Notice that after the hero loads that the "cape message" is no longer empty.


#### Step 7

Stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c`. This lab is complete.



## Lab 6: 6 - Component Communication

This lab will walk you through how to communicate between a parent (Heroes) and child (HeroDetail) component. You will learn to use props to pass values from parent to child. You will learn how to create custom events from the child that notify the parent component when something has occurred.




### Exercise 1: Passing a selected item to a child component

In this exercise you will learn how to pass a value in data model in a parent component to a child component.




#### Step 1

Open the `labs/06-component-communication/begin` folder in your editor and run `npm install`


#### Step 2

Run the app using the command `npm run serve`. Then browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Notice a list of heroes are displayed but nothing visibly happens when you selected a hero.


#### Step 3

The `HeroDetail` component displays a hero's details in a form and should allow edits.

Open the `HeroDetail` component in `src/components/hero-detail.vue` and go to the script code section.


#### Step 4

We want the `HeroDetail` component to accept a hero as input from a parent component. Add the `props` section to this component and define a prop named `hero`, that is of type `Object`, and defaults to a function that returns an empty object.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `props` section should be at the same level as the `data()` function. See the following code to see what your props might look like.

```javascript
export default {
  name: "HeroDetail",
  props: {
    hero: {
      type: Object,
      default: () => {}
    }
  },
```
</course-item>

#### Step 5

The `HeroDetail` component's template binds to the hero using the data model named `clonedHero`. Notice the `clonedHero` is set to an empty object currently. We could bind directly to the prop `hero`, however it is not recommended to modify the prop in a child component as data should not flow from child to parent. Thus, this component binds to the `clonedHero` data model.

Now clone the `hero` prop into the `clonedHero` model.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  You can use the spread operator to extract the `hero` prop's properties out, and then add them back to the `clonedHero`. See the following code to see what your `clonedHero` might look like.

```javascript
data() {
  return {
    clonedHero: { ...this.hero },
    message: ""
  };
},
```
</course-item>

#### Step 6

Open the _Heroes_ view in `src/components/heroes.vue` and go to the script code section. Make the `HeroDetail` component a dependency of the `Heroes` component.

You'll need to import the `HeroDetail` component from the `@/components/hero-detail` and add the `HeroDetail` to the `Heroes` component's `components` section.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The `components` section should be at the same level as the `data()` function. See the following code to see what your code might look like.

```javascript
import HeroDetail from "@/components/hero-detail";

export default {
  name: "Heroes",
  data() {
    return {
      selectedHero: undefined,
      heroes: []
    };
  },
  components: {
    HeroDetail
  },
```
</course-item>

#### Step 7

Now place the `HeroDetail` component in the template, just below the closing `</ul>` tag showing the heroes list. Pass the `selectedHero` model into the `HeroDetail` component's `hero` prop, and only add this component to the DOM if a hero has actually been selected.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  See the following code to see what your template might look like.

```html
<HeroDetail :hero="selectedHero" v-if="selectedHero"/>
```
</course-item>

#### Step 8

You just added a `v-if` to only show the `HeroDetail` component if a hero has been selected. Now add a similar `v-if` binding to the `<ul>` that lists the heroes, and only show the list if a hero has _not_ been selected.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  See the following code to see what your template might look like.

```html
<ul v-if="!selectedHero">
```
</course-item>

#### Step 9

Now when you use the running app and select a hero, the list should disappear and the selected hero's details should be visible.



### Exercise 2: Creating custom events

In this exercise you will create custom events that let the `HeroDetail` component notify its parent `Heroes` component when a user presses the cancel or save buttons.




#### Step 1

Open the `HeroDetail` view in `src/components/hero-detail.vue` and notice the methods `cancelHero` and `saveHero` have no code in them. We're going to add code that fires when the user presses the cancel and save buttons next.


#### Step 2

When the user presses the cancel button, fire a custom event named `cancel` from the `cancelHero` method.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  Use the `this.$emit()` function.

</course-item>

#### Step 3

When the user presses the save button, fire a custom event named `save` from the `saveHero` method. Pass the `clonedHero` as the with the event.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  Use the `this.$emit()` function and pass the `clonedHero` as the second argument. Your code may look like the following.

```javascript
methods: {
  cancelHero() {
    this.$emit("cancel");
  },
  saveHero() {
    this.$emit("save", this.clonedHero);
  }
```
</course-item>

#### Step 4

Open the `Heroes` view in `src/components/heroes.vue`. Next we're going to listen for those custom events we just created.


#### Step 5

When the user presses the cancel button in the `HeroDetail` component, we want to set the `Heroes` component's selected hero to `undefined` (de-selecting it).

Create a method in the `Heroes` component named `unselectedHero` and have it unselected the selected hero.


#### Step 6

In the template of your `Heroes` component, bind the `HeroDetail`'s `cancel` event to fire the method you just created in the previous step to unselect the hero.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  Your code may look like the following.

```html
<HeroDetail :hero="selectedHero" @cancel="unselectHero" v-if="selectedHero"/>
```
</course-item>

#### Step 7

When the user presses the save button in the `HeroDetail` component, we want to set the `Heroes` component's selected hero to `undefined` (de-selecting it) and replace the hero with the updated values.

Paste the following code that creates a method in the `Heroes` component named `saveHero`. Notice it unselects the `selectedHero`, first. Then it finds the hero that was just modified, replaces it in the array of heroes with the updated hero, and then clones the array to create a fresh list of heroes.

```javascript
saveHero(hero) {
  this.selectedHero = undefined;
  const index = this.heroes.findIndex(h => h.id === hero.id);
  this.heroes.splice(index, 1, hero);
  this.heroes = [...this.heroes];
},
```

#### Step 8

In the template of your `Heroes` component, bind the `HeroDetail`'s `save` event to fire the method you just created in the previous step.


<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  Your code may look like the following.

```html
<HeroDetail
  :hero="selectedHero"
  @save="saveHero"
  @cancel="unselectHero"
  v-if="selectedHero"
/>
```
</course-item>

#### Step 9

Now use the running app and select a hero and edit that hero's values. Then press save. You should see the updated values appear in your hero list.

When you select a hero and edit their values, then press cancel, the changes you made are ignored.


#### Step 10

Stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c`. This lab is complete.



## Lab 7: 7 - Accessing Data using HTTP

This lab will walk you through using the `axios` library to make HTTP calls to the server to retrieve data.

### Exercise 1: Installing and Using Axios

In this exercise you'll use `npm` to install the axios library. You'll then use axios to make a GET request to the server to retrieve heroes that can be used in a component.

#### Step 1

Open `labs/07-http/begin` in your editor.

#### Step 2

Open a terminal window and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

#### Step 3

Now run `npm install axios` in the terminal to install the `axios` library.

#### Step 4

Open `package.json` in your editor and you should notice that `axios` is now listed in the dependencies.

#### Step 5

Create a new file named `heroes.js` in the `src` folder of the project.

#### Step 6

Import `axios` into the top of the file.

```javascript
import axios from "axios";
```

#### Step 7

Add the following constant to define the URL that will be called to retrieve data. 

```javascript
const URL = "http://localhost:8080/heroes.json";
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
The `heroes.json` file is located in the `public` folder of the project.
</course-item>

#### Step 8

Create the following function to handle retrieving heroes from the server.

```javascript
export default function getHeroes() {

}
```

#### Step 9

Add the following code into the `getHeroes()` function to axios to make a GET request to the server.

```javascript
return axios
    .get(URL)
    .then(res => res.data)
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

#### Step 10

Save `heroes.js` and continue to the next exercise.


### Exercise 2: Retrieving Heroes in a Component

In this exercise you'll consume the `heroes.js` function created in the previous exercise in a component and use it to retrieve heroes.

#### Step 1

Open `src/components/heroes.vue` in the editor.

#### Step 2

Take a moment to explore the HTML code located in the template as well as the script section. Notice that the template handles looping through heroes and displaying them as cards. The code handles loading heroes and performing other functionality.

#### Step 3

Add the following code to the top of the `scripts` code to import the `heroes.js` module.

```javascript
import getHeroes from "@/heroes";
```

#### Step 4

Add the following code into the existing `getHeroes()` function within the component code to handle calling the server to retrieve heroes using the `axios` library.

```javascript
return await getHeroes();
```

#### Step 5

Run the following command to start the server and run the application.

```console
npm run serve
```

#### Step 6

Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see heroes displayed in the page. If not, use the browser's Developer Tools console to look for any errors that may need to be fixed.


#### Step 7

Stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c`. This lab is complete.


## Lab 8: 8 - Routing

This lab will walk you through routing and how it can be used to load and display different components. You'll learn how to define routes, work with the `router-view` directive, and link to routes using `router-link`.


### Exercise 1: Defining Routes

In this exercise you'll explore the lab application code and define routes to display Villains and Orders components.




#### Step 1

Open `labs/08-routing/begin` in your editor.


#### Step 2

Open a terminal window in the root of the project and run `vue add router`. This adds the Vue router to your dependencies and includes it n your app.

When you are prompted to use history mode, type `y` and press `ENTER`.


#### Step 3

Notice that the Vue CLi tells you that several files have been updated. The `router.js` file now contains all of your routing/navigation logic and tells Vue to use the router. The `App.vue` file now contains a place for the routes to show their views (the `<router-view>`).

```command-line
The following files have been updated / added:

  src/router.js
  src/views/About.vue
  src/views/Home.vue
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  src/App.vue
  src/main.js
```

#### Step 4

We also have new files `Home.vue` and `About.vue`. Let's delete those because we'll be adding our own views.

We'll be using the following files instead:

*   villains-list.vue

*   orders-list.vue

*   not-found.vue


They'll be displayed in the application using routing.


#### Step 5

Open `router.js`. Notice that `vue-router` along with the `About` and `Home` views are imported at the top of the file. We removed the About and Home views, so let's remove their imports too.


#### Step 6

Open `router.js` and and import `villains-list.vue` and the `heroes-list.vue` at the top of the file.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Router from 'vue-router';
import VillainsList from './views/villains-list.vue';
import HeroesList from './views/heroes-list.vue';

Vue.use(Router);
```

#### Step 7

Go to the `router.js` file and look for the route definitions. Change the default path of `/` from home to villains. This `villains-list.vue` will load using eager loading because we specify the component explicitly.

```javascript
routes: [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'villains',
    component: VillainsList
  },
```

#### Step 8

In `router.js`, look for the route definitions. Add a route definition such that `/heroes` displays the `heroes-list.vue`.

```javascript
routes: [
  {
    path: '/heroes',
    name: 'heroes',
    component: HeroesList
  },
```

#### Step 9

Go to the `router.js` file and look for the route definitions. Change the `/about` path from about to orders. Use the lazy loading syntax for orders.

```javascript
{
  path: '/orders',
  name: 'orders',
  component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "orders" */ './views/orders-list.vue')
}
```

#### Step 10

Go to the `router.js` file and look for the route definitions. Add a path at the end of the route definitions to catch all unknown routes, and send it to the not-found view. You will also want to import the `not-found.vue` file at the top of this file.

```javascript
import NotFound from './views/not-found.vue';

///

{ path: '*', component: NotFound }
```

#### Step 11

Open `App.vue` and notice we have a `router-link` pointing to `/` for Home and `/about` for About. Update the Home route to point to say Villains.

```html
<div id="nav">
  <router-link to="/">Villains</router-link>
  |
  <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
</div>
<router-view />
```

#### Step 12

Run `npm run serve` and visit `http://localhost:8080` in the browser. Now explore the routing navigation you just successfully created!



### Exercise 2: Router Links and Parameters

In this exercise you'll use the `router-link` component to create a link to a route. You'll also create a computed property that will be used to access a route parameter value and display it.




#### Step 1

Open `villains-list.vue`. Locate the `Add router-link Here` comment and replace it with the following code to link to the `orders-list.vue` and pass it the order ID.

```html
<router-link :to="{ name: 'orders', params: { id: v.id }}">
  View Orders
</router-link>
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="Defining a Route Parameter">
  Notice that you're using the `name` property to reference the name of the route created earlier and the `params` property to define the value of the `id` route parameter.

</course-item>

#### Step 2

Open `orders-list.vue`. Notice that the top of the template writes out the value of a `villainId` property.


#### Step 3

Locate the `Add router-link Here` comment in the `orders-list.vue` template. Replace the comment with the following code to link back to the `villains-list.vue`.

```javascript
<router-link :to="{ name: 'villains' }">View Villains</router-link>
```

#### Step 4

Add a new computed property named `villainId` into the component's script section.

The computed property function should accept a single parameter named `vm` and return a value of `vm.$route.params.id`. Click on the `Hint` below if you need help.


<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="Using $route">
  The $route object can be used to access route parameters (such as the `:id` parameter defined in the previous exercise) or even access query-string parameters.

</course-item>

<course-item
  type="Hint"
  title="Need Help?">
  The computed property function should look like the following:

```javascript
villainId: vm => vm.$route.params.id;
```
</course-item>

#### Step 5

Run `npm run serve` to build the project and start the local server. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in the browser.


#### Step 6

A list of villains should be displayed. Click on the `View Orders` link next to any villain to see their orders. Notice that the villain's `Id` is shown.


#### Step 7

Stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c`. This lab is complete.



## Lab 9: 9 - Managing State

This lab will walk you through using `Vuex` to handle state management in a Vue.js application that will allow users to work with a shopping cart.




### Exercise 1: Create Your Vuex Store

In this exercise you'll add Vuex to your app and create your data store.




#### Step 1

Open `labs/09-vuex-state/begin` in your editor.


#### Step 2

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

#### Step 3

Open a terminal window in the root of the project and run `vue add vuex`. This adds Vuex to your dependencies and includes it in your app. Notice your terminal displays what files were modified by this command to ad Vuex.


#### Step 4

Open `package.json` and notice that a new dependency has been added for `vuex`.


#### Step 5

Let's now look at what the `vue add vuex` command did to the project. Open the `src` folder and notice that a `store.js` file has been added. It does the following:

*   Tells Vue to use Vuex by calling `Vue.use(Vuex)`

*   Creates a new `Vuex.Store` object with `state`, `mutations`, and `actions` properties.


<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  The `store.js` file is also imported into `main.js` and is passed to the `Vue` object created there.

</course-item>

#### Step 6

Add the following code **immediately above** the `export` statement in `store.js`. This URL will be used to retrieve products used in the application.

```javascript
const URL = 'http://localhost:8080/products.json';
```

#### Step 7

Locate the `state` property in `Vuex.Store` and add the following code into it.

```javascript
cart: [],
products: []
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  These two properties will be stored by Vuex in the store and be accessible throughout the entire application.

</course-item>

#### Step 8

Copy and paste the following code into the `mutations` property in `Vuex.Store` to provide add, remove, and clear functionality to the store. Mutations are what mutates (changes) the state in the store.

```javascript
addProduct({ products }, product) {
  products.push(product)
},
addToCart({ cart }, product) {
  const itemIndex = cart.findIndex(item => item.id === product.id);
  if (itemIndex === -1) {
    cart.push({ ...product, quantity: 1, total: product.price })
  } else {
    let cartItem = cart[itemIndex];
    cartItem.quantity++;
    cartItem.total = cartItem.price * cartItem.quantity;
  }
},
removeFromCart({ cart }, item) {
  const itemIndex = cart.findIndex(cartItem => cartItem.id === item.id);
  cart.splice(itemIndex, 1);
}
```

#### Step 9

We won;t be calling mutations directly, because we do not want to mutate the store from a component. Instead we want to fire an action that will decide what should happen to the state. The actions may call 0 or many mutations.

Copy the following code into the `actions` property. This will create three actions which we will call to add to the cart, get the products, and remove an item from the cart.

```javascript
addToCartAction({ commit }, product) {
  commit('addToCart', product);
},
getProductsAction({ state, commit }) {
  if (!state.products.length) {
    fetch(URL)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(products => {
        for (let product of products) {
          commit('addProduct', {
            id: product.id,
            name: product.name,
            price: product.price
          });
        }
      });
  }
},
removeFromCartAction({ commit }, item) {
  commit('removeFromCart', item);
}
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  Note that we suffix each action with the word "Action" to make sure there are no naming conflicts with mutations that may have the same name.

</course-item>

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  Note that the action function calls can use destructuring to access `commit` and `state` objects. The `commit` object lets the action commit a mutation. The `state` object gives the action access to the state.

</course-item>

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  Note that Axios or another library could be used to make the HTTP call as well as shown in the HTTP lab.

</course-item>

#### Step 10

Your work in `store.js` is almost done! To finish things up, add a `getters` property into the `Vuex.Store` object at the same level as the `actions`, `mutations`, and `state`. Then create a custom `cartTotal` property in the `getters` property. This property will return the shopping cart's total cost.

```javascript
getters: {
  cartTotal: ({ cart }) => {
    let total = 0;
    for (let item of cart) {
      total += item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    return total;
  }
}
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  Note that Axios or another library could be used to Don't forget to add a comma after the last `actions` property bracket.

</course-item>

#### Step 11

Save `store.js` before continuing.


#### Step 12

Run the command `npm run build` from your terminal to build your app. This will verify that you have no errors before continuing to the next exercise.


### Exercise 2: Using the Vuex Store in Components

In this exercise you'll add functionality into components to handle storing and retrieving state from the Vuex store.




#### Step 1

Open `src/views/products.vue` in your editor and take a moment to note the following:

*   Examine the HTML code in the template. Notice that it renders products as well as a `Cart` component.

*   Notice that Vuex functionality is imported in the `scripts` section. The `mapState` and `mapActions` functions will be used to access store state and call into the store's actions.


#### Step 2

Add the following code into the `methods` property:

```javascript
...mapActions(["getProductsAction", "addToCartAction"])
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  The `mapActions` code makes the `getProductsAction` and `addToCartAction` actions in the Vuex store accessible to the component.

</course-item>

#### Step 3

Add the following code into the component's `computed` property.

```javascript
...mapState(['products'])
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  This will allow the `products` property from the Vuex store's `state` to be used in the component. Take a moment to locate the `v-for` directive in the component's template to see where the `products` property is used.

</course-item>

#### Step 4

Open `src/components/cart.vue` in your editor. Notice that the component's template handles rendering cart items.


#### Step 5

Locate the `scripts` section and note how it uses `mapState()` and `mapGetters()` to make the store's `cart` and `cartTotal` values available to the component.


#### Step 6

Add the following code into the `methods` property of the component.

```javascript
...mapActions(['removeFromCartAction'])
```

<course-item
  type="Note"
  title="">
  This code allows the `removeFromCartAction()` function defined in the store's actions property to be used by the `Cart` component. The `removeFromCartAction()` function is called when a button in the template is clicked.

</course-item>

#### Step 7

Save all of the files you've modified up to this point.


#### Step 8

Run the following command to start the server and run the application.

```console
npm run serve
```

#### Step 9

Browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Click on the `Products` item in the menu. Notice that products are displayed but that the cart is empty. Click on the `Buy` button next to a product and it should be added into the cart. You can click on a product multiple times to increase the quantity purchased. Cart items can be removed by clicking the `X` button next to the item.


#### Step 10

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented a Vuex store!

#### Step 11

Stop the server by pressing `ctrl+c`. This lab is complete.
